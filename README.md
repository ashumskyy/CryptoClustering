# CryptoClustering

# # # After visually analyzing the cluster analysis results using K-Means, we can see that using fewer features to cluster the data has an impact on how well the clusters are separated and how easy the data points are to read.

We can see, that the scatter plot optimized with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) shows better separation between clusters. The data points are clearly defined and clustered together, making it easier to read the plot. The scatter plot also shows outlined data points such as Celsius-Degree-Token and Ethlend, which were not clear in the original scatter plot. Both plots are precise in the range of x(-2:2) and y(-2:3).

Overall, using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means can impact how well the clusters are separated and how easy the data points are to read. Applying PCA to the original data can help improve the visualization of the clusters and make the data points easier to interpret.
